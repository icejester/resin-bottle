# Not your average skull
I had been wanting to make this bottle for some time. There was smething I wanted to do in the physical world, so there isn't really anything earth-shattering from a software perspective. If you're interested in the code aspect, please see the [Canada Day Skull](https://github.com/icejester/canada-day-skull/) project.

# The goal
I wanted to fall back to clear resin with visible, but pretty electronics. I had been using LED strips that, while functional, looked kinda janky. I wanted a steampunk / Edison kind of feel. I had gone through several iterations, but I was finally able to find a wire / LED structure that was firm enough to hold a shape yet flexible enough to bend a little.

I had a few failures, but steeled on solid core steel wire 22GA. It reacted well to holding a shape, and the wires were exactly what I was looking for. Before long, I had made myself an LED strip that looked pretty cool...

There was a time, for a brief few moments that I thought, "I wont have to worry about the wires touching... They'll be in resin!" They're bare steel, so I needed to douse them in confomal coating. A process that I honestly thought would be worse.Just paint it on, let it drip. When it's done, it's plenty flexible to squeeze into a bottle.
